# Tree-like-neural-network

This is a project of thesis.

The proposed deep tree-like neural networks mimic the architecture of the relevant decision trees, and the input variables are determined mostly by decision trees. 

Some real-world datasets will be used to compare the performances of the proposed tree-like neural networks and the standard densely connected neural networks.
